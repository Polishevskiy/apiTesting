Rest-Assured is a Java library used to test RESTful Web Services. It provides a fluent API to easily construct HTTP requests, send them to a web service, and validate the response. It allows developers to write functional and integration tests for RESTful web services using a simple and expressive syntax.

Rest-Assured is built on top of the Apache HTTP Client and uses Gson, Jackson, and XML serialization libraries to serialize and deserialize data. It provides support for various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. and supports various authentication methods such as basic, digest, and OAuth.

To use Rest-Assured in a Java project, you need to add the Rest-Assured dependency to your project's build configuration file (such as pom.xml for Maven) and import the Rest-Assured library in your test class.

Overall, Rest-Assured provides a convenient and powerful tool for testing RESTful web services in Java. Its fluent API and support for various authentication methods make it easy to write and maintain tests for web services.
